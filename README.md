# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

This project aims to predict Alzheimer's disease using deep learning techniques. It leverages a dataset containing various medical features, such as brain scans, genetic data, and patient history, to train a deep neural network model capable of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease early.

## Project Description
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory loss, confusion, and changes in behavior. Early detection of Alzheimer's is crucial to start treatment and improve quality of life. This project uses deep learning algorithms to predict Alzheimer's disease based on medical data, with the goal of developing an accurate and efficient tool for early diagnosis.

## Dataset
The model is trained using a dataset that contains features like:
- Brain imaging scans (MRI, PET scans)
- Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
- Genetic information (APOE4 gene status)
- Cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, etc.)

This dataset can be found in various repositories, such as the [ADNI dataset](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/).

### Data Preprocessing
Before training, the data goes through several preprocessing steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, normalize data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from raw data.
3. **Data Augmentation**: For image data, apply augmentations like rotations, flips, and zoom to improve model robustness.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gautamvdwivedi/alzheimers-disease-prediction-using-deep-learning
   cd alzheimers-disease-prediction
